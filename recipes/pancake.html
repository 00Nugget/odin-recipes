<p>Made too much batter? No problem. Your pancake batter keeps in the fridge for up to two days! Freeze the rest if you plan to keep it longer. Pancake batter can keep up to a month in the freezer!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 <sup>1/2</sup> cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 <sup>1/2</sup> teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1/4</sup> teaspoon salt <em>(or more to taste)</em></li>
    <li>1 <sup>1/4</sup> cups milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter <em>(melted)</em></li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step One:</h4>
<p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>
<br>
<h4>Step Two:</h4>
<p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
